Help people get to the right floor—but don’t take their word for it. Some of them will lie to you. Click on them to check their ID card before you press that elevator button. Trust, but verify.

This was meant to be a small weird game about people, deception, and mildly stressful elevator work. It’s not totally done (some ideas never made it in, and there are a few rough edges) but I kind of lost interest halfway through. Still, there’s something charming in the half-finished mess, so I’m putting it out there in case someone enjoys it (or wants to improve on it).
